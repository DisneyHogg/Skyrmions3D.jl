# Summary
*A summary describing the high-level functionality and purpose of the software for a diverse, non-specialist audience.*


Solitons are solutions to partial differential equations which behave like particles in certain ways: they have finite extent, a well defined centre of mass and momentum, and they retain their shape after scattering off each other. Skyrmions were introduced in the 1960s as topological solitons which serve as low-energy models of nuclei. Mathematically they are defined as smooth maps $U: \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathrm{SU}(2)$ which minimise a certain integral (the Skyrme energy) subject to boundary conditions which topologically stabilise the field $U$ so as to prevent it only occupying the vacuum solution $U=1$. Analytically writing down skyrmions fields is difficult and accordingly many approximation of skyrmions fields, using for example rational maps or the ADHM data of instantons, have been proposed. 

`Skyrmions3D.jl` allows for the creation, transformation, and visualisation of skyrmions generated via various approximations already provided in the package. Moreover, the implementation is written flexibly so as to allow users to investigate their own novel skyrmion approximations. Underlying algorithms are state of the art, and written so as to exploit efficiencies of Julia. 

# Statement of need
*A Statement of need section that clearly illustrates the research purpose of the software and places it in the context of related work.*


Computational tools have long been important to the study of topological solitons due to the many complicated high-dimensional integrals which must be executed in order to determine even fundamental properties of a soliton such as its energy. This difficulty is compounded in the study of skyrmions, where exact Skyrme fields are not available. Despite such a necessity, aside from `Skyrmions3D.jl` there are no open-source packages available for the study of 3-dimensional skyrmions. This is a marked difference to the study of 2-dimensional magnetic skyrmions where many tools are available, for example [@Beg2022], [@CortesOrtuno019], [@KanaszNagy2015]. 

As such `Skyrmions3D.jl` provides a tool which lowers barriers to skyrmion research presented by the computational skill required, prevents inefficies arising from duplication of software, supports rigorous science by making source code open, and aids reproducibility across publications.

The Skyrme model is a non-linear sigma model with field $U: \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathrm{SU}(2)$, designed such that the topolocial solitons serve as models of baryons: an element in $SU(2)$ may be considered as a unit quaternion, and the coefficients of its imaginary parts are taken to be pion field. Upon imposing a boundary condition that $\lim_{|x| \to \infty} U(x) = 1$, $U$ determines a map $S^3 \to S^3$ and the integer which determines the homotopy class of that map in $\pi_3(S^3) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ is to be interpreted as the baryon number. The skyrmions are the fields which minimise the Skyrme energy 
$$
E = \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} \left ( \left \lvert U^{-1} dU \right \rvert^2 + \left \lvert U^{-1} dU \wedge U^{-1} dU \right\rvert^2 \right) d^3 x
$$
in each homotopy class. The remarkable fact about the Skyrme model is that, despite its simplicity, the scattering and energy levels of skyrmions within the model accurately predict the observed properties of baryons when scales $F_\pi$, $e$, and $m_\pi$ (corresponding to the pion decay constant, Skyrme parameter, and tree-level pion mass repsectivey, determined via experiment) are introduced. As a result, there is hope that studying the skyrme model (and simple modification thereof) can shed light into the theory of nuclei. For a comprehensive background on skyrmions and the surrounding literature see [@Manton2004], [@Manton2022]. 

`Skyrmions3D.jl` implements a structure in Julia to describe numerically a skyrmion. It has
 - the discrete grid $(x_i, y_j, z_k)$ of spatial values at which the Skyrme field will be given, 
 - the pion field value at the points in the spatial grid, 
 - the physical parameters $m_\pi$, $F_\pi$, $e$, and
 - boundary conditions determing how the Skyrme field is to be treated at the edge of the grid. 

Explicit formula for skyrmion fields which attain the minimal energy are not known, and so one must work with approximate ...

Given skyrmions there are a variety of ways to manipulate them:
 - one can translate and (iso)rotate them, for example by sending $U(x)$ to $U(x-x_0)$ when translating by fixed $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}^3$, and
 - one can combine two skyrmions via the product ansatz.
Moreover, there are ...


An incomplete list that LDH thinks should be included in this section:
 - a brief overview of the features offered by the package
 - the colouring of plots, wasn't it a paper of CH which introduced the colouring convention?
 - some small details about the algorithms used where they are notable, e.g. marching cubes has become *the* tool for plotting isosurfaces in the solitons community, reference the Harland paper for efficient computation of holonomy, anything about arrested newton flow?
 - the webpage providing comprehensive documentation and examples of usage
 - the papers which have currently used Skyrmions3D, advertised on a webpage
 - the flexibility to employ Skyrmions in other projects, cite [@Cork2025].
