# Statement of need

A Statement of need section that clearly illustrates the research purpose of the software and places it in the context of related work.

# Background

A bit of background about skyrmions, their mathematics, and existing work. 

A list of key references, including to other software addressing related needs. Note that the references should include full names of venues, e.g., journals and conferences, not abbreviations only understood in the context of a specific discipline.

Note that the paper begins by a metadata section (the enclosing â€” lines are mandatory) and ends with a References heading, and the references are built automatically from the content in the .bib file. You should enter in-text citations in the paper body following correct Markdown citation syntax. Also note that the references include full names of venues, e.g., journals and conferences, not abbreviations only understood in the context of a specific discipline.
