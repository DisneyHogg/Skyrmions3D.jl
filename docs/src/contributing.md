# Contributing

There are many way to contribute to `Skyrmions3D`. These include

* adding examples to the documentation,
* fixing bugs and typos,
* implementing new skyrmion types. 

If you want to do any of the above, first [raise an issue on the GitHub page](https://github.com/chrishalcrow/Skyrmions3D.jl/issues) to discuss the idea with others. This conversation can help understand exactly the best way to fix a bug / implement a new feature using the experience of the community. 

To then make the change, [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) the `Skyrmions3D` repository on GitHub, make the edits to your fork of the source code, and then [open a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). After you have opened the pull request, other members of the community will review the changes. They may add comments, request tweaks to the code, or add changes of their own. More about pull requests can be read [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
