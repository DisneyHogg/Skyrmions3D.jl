### Learning resources

Please take a look at the API on this page, located in the sidebar.

There is  a tutorial available on the main [github](https://github.com/chrishalcrow/Skyrmions3D.jl.git) repo, either as a Julia file or a Jupyter notepad.

I have also made [one](https://youtu.be/TI5huk6Rqos) or [two](https://youtu.be/HeSs7yVGXR4) YouTube videos about the package.

### Installation

TaylorSeries.jl is not yet a registered package, hence you must install it directly from github. You can do this directly in the REPL by first entering package mode (type ']') then writing 'add https://github.com/chrishalcrow/Skyrmions3D.jl.git'. Or you can write ']add https://github.com/chrishalcrow/Skyrmions3D.jl.git' into a cell in Jupyter notepad (this must be the _only thing_ in the cell).

### Authors

I am Chris Halcrow, a postdoc at KTH in Stockholm. I would love there to be more authors of this package. Please join in.
